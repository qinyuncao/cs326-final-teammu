### **Steps to Build Project**:
1. Establish general concept of the idea and how it will specifically work. Specifically, we're creating a web application that allows users to write and view reviews of different residential halls on UMass' campus. They will be able to interact with reviews by liking/disliking them. They will also be able to delete their own reviews.
2. Draw wireframes for the layout of the site and the different pages we will need. For us, we needed a home page, write a review page, review rankings page, detailed review page, log-in page, and sign-up page.
3. Code the HTML/CSS framework for the site to design how the user interface will look.
4. Code the frontend Javascript to populate the page with the right data and dynamically create all the necessary HTML elements.
5. Code the backend Javascript server to handle GET and POST requests to allow our web application to function adequately.
6. Connect the frontend and backend Javascript to populate the page with the necessary data which is received from the server. Also to post the necessary data from user input.

Still to be done:

7. Set up the database to store the data in an ideal way.
