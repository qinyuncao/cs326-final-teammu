### **Wireframes**:
This is the wireframe for our home page. It has a simple design, with the ability to log in or sign up at the top right, and write a review, and check Residential hall ranking. The ability to select a residence hall and be taken to the corresponding rating/review page. There are also some images of halls on campus to provide a pleasant and functional aesthetic to the site.

This is the wireframe for the overall rank for all residential halls. If the user wants to see the specific rate score of each residential hall, just clicking the right arrow, and then it would link to the specific score for each factor as well as the reviews.

This is the wireframe for the rate score of a residential hall/review page after clicking the right arrow of each hall. We are using Crabtree Hall, just an an example. There are other people's review and the total score. The user can also change the residence hall from this page as well. If the user is logged in, they can like and dislike a review as well as edit/delete their own review.

This is the wireframe for the 'write a review' page. Here, a user selects which hall they are reviewing. Then, they rate the hall on five factors on a scale of 1-20. The user also types a more detailed, long-form review. Additionally, the user provides at least one tag which will benefit the search function at the top of site.

This is the wireframe for the Log In page. Here, the user would enter their username and password to log in to the site. This would allow the user the ability to write reviews as well as interact with a review by liking or disliking.
