### **Innovative Idea**:
The concept of our application is of a review platform specifically for UMass students towards residential halls. Many students have perceptions of what life is like in a certain residential community on campus but they can never truly know without living there themselves. This application would allow UMass students to see the thoughts of other students towards a residential hall to gain valuable insight in their decision making process. We plan on structuring the application to collect reviews on various factors such as location, social life, dining halls, etc. This application is unique as there is not a designated platform for UMass students to solely review residential halls in a structured way. The concept of review websites is not new, but in focusing on residential halls and in targeting the UMass student population, this website becomes unique. Because of this, we do not believe our application relates to an existing application.

### **Important Components**:
1. Rate score system for each residential hall. Rate for different factors for one residential hall, such as location, convenienc, etc.
2. Filter of different factors, such as distance to dining halls, distance to classroom, distance to bus stop, elevator, room type(single, double, triple, suite).
3. Review system for each residential hall.
4. Like or Dislike for each review.
5. Map, one button for each residential hall, click for precise map.
