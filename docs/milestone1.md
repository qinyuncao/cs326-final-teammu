### **Data Interactions**:
In our site, upon signing up and being logged in, a user can read and write reviews for each undergraduate residential hall on campus as well as interact with each review by liking or disliking it. For each review, there are five categories that the user rates on a scale from 1-20. These five categories are convenience, comfort, privacy, facility, and cleanliness. A user can also provide a more thorough review as well as providing tags to characterize their experience with the residential hall. A user can see all the reviews on a residential hall and like or dislike each review. A user can also see the summary of the ratings on each of the five categories as well as see an overall score for the hall out of 100.

### **Wireframes and HTML Pages**:
This is the wireframe for our home page. It has a simple design, with the ability to log in or sign up at the top right, and write a review, and check Residential hall ranking. The ability to select a residence hall and be taken to the corresponding rating/review page. There are also some images of halls on campus to provide a pleasant and functional aesthetic to the site.
